#About this project

This is a prototype history tool chronicling alpha development of the NHS Secondary Care Application Capability framework (replacing the NHS Digital Capabilities Framework) aligned to the NHS One Architecture Model (OAM). 

Its focus within OAM is on digital secondary care application capabilities, aiming to make sure its outputs are high quality, free of duplication and immediately consumable by OAM.

#Scope
The alpha prototype will:

1. increase the team’s understanding of its target users’ needs (CIOs, heads of national programmes in NHSE, other digital leaders) across secondary care, NHSE and DHSC, focusing specifically on existing and new use cases for interacting with OAM capability content
2. co-design and iteratively develop an accessible front-end which enables these users to use relevant OAM capability views to support their planning, procurement, and service transformation decisions
