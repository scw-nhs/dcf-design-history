## About this alpha service

Work started in October 2025 to update the existing Digital Capabilities Framework in line with [the team's rapid discovery findings](/discovery/). This focused on current and future users' needs, and how they have changed since the framework was first introduced to support the shift from paper-based and electronic patient record systems to modern digital EPRs.

The alpha's working title is **'NHS Secondary Care Application Capabilities'**. This reflects user research findings that 'Digital Capabilities Framework' was not well understood, and also the need to align it to the NHS One Architecture Model (OAM). Its focus within OAM is on digital secondary care application capabilities, aiming to make sure its outputs are high quality, free of duplication and immediately consumable by OAM. 

The alpha prototype will:

1. increase the team's understanding of its target users' needs (CIOs, heads of national programmes in NHSE, other digital leaders) across secondary care, NHSE and DHSC, focusing specifically on existing and new use cases for interacting with OAM capability content
2. co-design and iteratively develop an accessible front-end which enables these users to use relevant OAM capability views to support their planning, procurement, and service transformation decisions
