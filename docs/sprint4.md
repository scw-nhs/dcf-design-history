## Sprint planning

The team spent this sprint planning, sizing and scoping the work needed to deliver against the team's objectives for the alpha, creating, assigning and sizing job tickets in Jira. The prototype helped guide and shape these conversations, particularly around sizing for migration- and mapping-related tickets.

## Internal sense-making

The team used the prototype to talk the OAM team through its proposed mapping - DCF user stories to Application Capabilities. It became clear that, as the first team to attempt to populate the OAM metamodel, more direction was needed from the OAM team on:

* mapping - potentially, Application Functions in DCF should map to Application Capabilities, not DCF user stories
* canonical sources - what might already exist that could be repurposed into OAM classes, for example for Service Types
* dependencies with other work - for example the team refreshing the WGLL framework are considering how OAM business capabilities could be populated

These questions were logged and meetings set up with the OAM team to discuss, allowing them time to consider options (set out in a short document).

## Decisions

The OAM team agreed that Application Functions in DCD should map to Application Capabilities. The team went away to look at whether DCF user stories could map to OAM service types and their constituent process types.
