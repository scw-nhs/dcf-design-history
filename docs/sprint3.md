## Framing the problem

Li Jenkins-Twist's [background to OAM]([/treatment-function-codes/](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/making-sense-system-describing-health-care-england-li-jenkins-twist-xpkwe/) was really useful context, as was the OAM team's [draft L1 and L2 business capabilities](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/li-jenkins-twist-40b215176_letstalkarchitecture-activity-7323282611827580928-kbEX/).

> "To develop truly joined-up care, we need to step back and develop a shared view of how the system functions â€“ what capabilities we need, the reality of patient journeys across care pathways, and where technology supports delivery. Not from the perspective of a single organisation, but from the intended outcomes and the perspective of the people the system is meant to serve." - Li Jenkins-Twist, NHSE Chief Enterprise Architect

The ACF team needed to work out how to present this shared view to users, relevant to their real-world tasks and priorities. The team knew from [user research in its discovery](/discovery/) that to be successful, the information service would need to be *useful*, *usable* and *used*. Phrased as questions, this grouped the recommendations into potential solutions (and assumptions) to test in the alpha:

### How can we make OAM ACF useful? 

1. design specific tools and functionality that supports users and use cases identified through research
2. show how OAM ACF can be used to support specific tasks, eg planning to deliver national and local priorities for service transfer and improvement
3. provide direct, explicit links to good practice, such as the [NHS What Good Looks Like framework](https://transform.england.nhs.uk/digitise-connect-transform/what-good-looks-like/what-good-looks-like-publication/) and [NHS Blueprints](https://future.nhs.uk/GDEcommunity/groupHome) on the FutureNHS website (login required).

### How can we make OAM ACF usable?

1. Make the framework open and accessible for anyone to use, eg
