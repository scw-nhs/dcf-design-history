## The 'baseline' - a single platform

One of the key user research and engagement findings from the discovery was that the current Digital Capabilities Framework exists on multiple platforms - NHSE Transformation web pages, Confluence and an Excel version hosted on FutureNHS.

> Some Excel users felt DCF held insufficient detail to determine if a supplier could deliver a capability, or for suppliers to build towards. Others, looking at Confluence, viewed DCF as too detailed and not for everyone. 

For the alpha, the team wanted to test its hypothesis that a single unified platform would help:

1. address unmet user needs and points of friction in user journeys identified in [the discovery](/discovery/)
2. provide a trusted 'single source of truth'
3. provide options to create tailored journeys and tools for different types of user and use cases
4. distinguish between the framework itself and derived products that support specific use cases
5. position secondary care application capabilities as a constituent part of the OAM

## Why WordPress?

The discovery highlighted problems with DCF's structure, navigability, consistency of language and search functionality. The team felt it'd be critical to test these things with users from the outset. Also, the team knew that, as a browser-based service, it would have to be accessible (to WCAG 2.1 AA) and built to either NHS or GOV.UK design patterns. 

This narrowed down its choice of prototype. Figma and AxureRP were felt to be better for trialling designs, whereas the team wanted to design, test and iterate navigation and categorisation from the outset. Also, identifying and filling content gaps and improving language meant that a content management system (CMS) would support content designers (the team felt this would be a significant part of its work).
